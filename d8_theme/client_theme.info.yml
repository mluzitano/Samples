  # The purpose of the gutter is to be able to place blocks but not have them appear.
  # The reason we want that is so that we can place them in twig files via Twig Tweaks
  # and also so we can embed blocks in a Paragraph using the Embed Block paragraph type,
  # which requires that blocks be placed before they can be referenced.
